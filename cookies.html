            <p class="mb-8">This Cookie Policy explains how AquaNestle Irrigation Services ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit our website. By using our website, you consent to the use of cookies as described in this policy. You can manage your cookie preferences at any time through your browser settings or the cookie consent manager on our website.</p>

            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>1. What Are Cookies?</h3>
                <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer, smartphone, or other device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the website owners. Cookies typically contain anonymous information such as a unique identifier, the site name, and some digits and numbers. They cannot carry viruses or install malware on your device. We use both session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until deleted). Cookies help us understand how our site is being used and improve your browsing experience.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>2. Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
                <p>We use several types of cookies: Strictly necessary cookies (essential for website functionality), performance cookies (help us improve the site), functionality cookies (remember your preferences), and targeting cookies (used by advertising networks). Each type serves a different purpose: essential cookies cannot be disabled as they are required for the site to function properly, analytics cookies help us understand visitor behavior, preference cookies remember your settings, and marketing cookies help deliver relevant ads. We may also use local storage and tracking pixels as part of our cookie technology.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>3. Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are essential for you to navigate our website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas or making purchases. Without these cookies, services you've asked for like shopping baskets or secure logins cannot be provided. They include cookies that remember your actions as you navigate from page to page, helping avoid the need to reauthenticate or reprocess each action. These cookies don't gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes and don't remember your preferences beyond your current visit. They are usually set in response to actions you take such as logging in or filling in forms.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>4. Performance Cookies</h3>
                <p>Performance cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, like which pages are visited most often and if users experience error messages. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor - all information is aggregated and therefore anonymous. We use Google Analytics cookies to help us improve our site by understanding what content is most valuable to our visitors. The data collected includes the number of visitors, where visitors come from, and the pages they visit. This helps us ensure the site is meeting user needs and identify areas for enhancement.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>5. Functionality Cookies</h3>
                <p>Functionality cookies allow our website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can be used to remember your login details, language preference, region selection, or font size settings. They may also be used to provide services you've requested such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. These cookies cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. The information collected may be anonymized and cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Some videos on our website may use cookies to anonymously gather statistics on how you got there and what videos you visited.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>6. Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are used to deliver ads more relevant to you and your interests based on your browsing history. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an ad and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They are typically placed by advertising networks with our permission. The cookies remember that you've visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. If you don't allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. Note that opting out doesn't mean you won't see ads - just that they'll be less relevant.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>7. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
                <p>Some cookies are set by services that appear on our website but are not under our control. These include cookies from social media platforms (if you share content on social media), embedded videos (like YouTube), and analytics services. Third-party cookies are subject to their respective privacy policies. We don't control how these cookies are used, so we suggest you check their websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them. We use reasonable efforts to implement only reputable third-party services that respect user privacy, but cannot be responsible for their cookie practices.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>8. How Long Do Cookies Stay On My Device?</h3>
                <p>The lifespan of a cookie depends on its purpose: Session cookies are temporary and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain until they expire or you delete them from your browser cache. First-party cookies we set typically last from a few hours up to 2 years. Third-party cookies may have different durations set by their providers. You can manually delete stored cookies through your browser settings at any time. Some cookies refresh each time you visit our website, while others have fixed expiration dates. The expiration period is set when the cookie is created and may vary across different cookie categories.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>9. Managing and Disabling Cookies</h3>
                <p>You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish through your browser settings. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. However, if you do this, you may need to manually adjust some preferences each time you visit our site, and some functionality may not work. Browser settings typically allow you to see what cookies you have and delete them individually or block cookies from particular sites. Each browser is different - check your browser's "Help" menu to learn how to change cookie preferences.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>10. Cookie Consent Manager</h3>
                <p>Our cookie consent manager tool allows you to selectively choose which categories of cookies you accept. You can access the manager via the button in our cookie notice banner or through a link in the website footer. The tool provides clear information about each cookie category and its purpose. Your preferences are stored in a cookie so we can remember your choices on subsequent visits. If you clear your browser cookies, you'll need to reset your preferences. The tool gives you granular control over non-essential cookies while ensuring essential functionality is maintained.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>11. Impact of Disabling Cookies</h3>
                <p>If you disable cookies completely, our website may not function properly. Essential features like account logins, shopping carts, and secure transactions may fail. Disabling performance cookies means we can't gather data to improve our site. Rejecting functionality cookies means the site won't remember your preferences. Blocking advertising cookies won't stop ads - they'll just become less relevant. Some embedded content (like videos) might not work without third-party cookies. We recommend keeping strictly necessary cookies enabled for full functionality and selectively disabling others based on your comfort level.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>12. Cookies We Use</h3>
                <p>Below is a detailed list of all cookies we use on our website with their purpose, category, and duration:</p>
                <p><strong>Essential:</strong> session_id (end of session), csrf_token (1 year)</p>
                <p><strong>Performance:</strong> _ga (2 years), _gid (24 hours)</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> language (1 year), font_size (1 year)</p>
                <p><strong>Advertising:</strong> visitor_id (1 year), fr (3 months)</p>
                <p>We review our cookie usage quarterly and update this list as needed. If we introduce new cookies significantly different from these, we'll update our policy and notify users through our website.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>13. Do Not Track Signals</h3>
                <p>Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites you don't want to have your online activities tracked. Currently, we do not respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals as there's no industry standard for implementation. However, we provide you the tools to control tracking through our cookie consent manager. Even if we receive a Do Not Track signal, essential cookies required for site operation will still be used. We monitor industry developments regarding Do Not Track standards and will revisit this policy if standards emerge.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>14. Cookie Policy Updates</h3>
                <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology, legislation, or our operations. When we make significant changes, we'll notify you through a notice on our website or other communication channels. The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates when the policy was last revised. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we use cookies. Your continued use of our website after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

            <div class="policy-point">
                <h3>15. International Data Transfers</h3>
                <p>Some of the third-party services we use may transfer cookie data outside your country of residence. For example, Google Analytics stores data in the United States. Where such transfers occur, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data in accordance with this policy and applicable law. The European Commission has determined that certain countries provide adequate data protection. For transfers to other countries, we rely on standard contractual clauses or other approved mechanisms. US-based services may be subject to lawful access by US authorities under certain circumstances.</p>

                <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data collected via cookies, including: Right to access (request copies of your data), right to rectification (correct inaccurate data), right to erasure (request deletion), right to restrict processing, right to data portability, and right to object to processing. You can exercise most of these rights regarding cookies through our cookie consent manager or your browser settings.
